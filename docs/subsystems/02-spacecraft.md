# SYS-02 — 星座与航天器

> Status: design specification; implementation not implied. Logical bounded context, not necessarily an independently deployed service.

## 1. Position and mission

**Position:** 空间资产及载荷能力的权威状态.

**Purpose:** Provide a separately testable domain with explicit authority over its state and measurable contracts. It participates in a whole-system Starlink-like broadband experiment while avoiding assumptions about undisclosed SpaceX implementations.

## 2. Core domain entities

- `Constellation`
- `Shell`
- `Satellite`
- `Payload`
- `Attitude`
- `PowerBudget`
- `HealthState`

Each entity must eventually have a schema, identifier, lifecycle and ownership rules. Physical quantities require units and coordinate/time conventions.

## 3. Internal modules and detailed capabilities

### 3.1 星座壳层和轨道面编目

Implement as an independently verifiable capability: specify inputs, output/state transition, physical or protocol assumptions, error handling, metrics and reference tests. Choose analytical approximations before protocol-accurate models where appropriate.

### 3.2 卫星发射/退役生命周期

Implement as an independently verifiable capability: specify inputs, output/state transition, physical or protocol assumptions, error handling, metrics and reference tests. Choose analytical approximations before protocol-accurate models where appropriate.

### 3.3 姿态与指向约束

Implement as an independently verifiable capability: specify inputs, output/state transition, physical or protocol assumptions, error handling, metrics and reference tests. Choose analytical approximations before protocol-accurate models where appropriate.

### 3.4 星上电源与热约束近似

Implement as an independently verifiable capability: specify inputs, output/state transition, physical or protocol assumptions, error handling, metrics and reference tests. Choose analytical approximations before protocol-accurate models where appropriate.

### 3.5 星载计算与转发能力

Implement as an independently verifiable capability: specify inputs, output/state transition, physical or protocol assumptions, error handling, metrics and reference tests. Choose analytical approximations before protocol-accurate models where appropriate.

### 3.6 载荷模式 bent-pipe/regenerative

Implement as an independently verifiable capability: specify inputs, output/state transition, physical or protocol assumptions, error handling, metrics and reference tests. Choose analytical approximations before protocol-accurate models where appropriate.

### 3.7 健康监测与降级

Implement as an independently verifiable capability: specify inputs, output/state transition, physical or protocol assumptions, error handling, metrics and reference tests. Choose analytical approximations before protocol-accurate models where appropriate.

### 3.8 星载资源分配边界

Implement as an independently verifiable capability: specify inputs, output/state transition, physical or protocol assumptions, error handling, metrics and reference tests. Choose analytical approximations before protocol-accurate models where appropriate.

## 4. Boundaries and dependencies

- **Primary upstream:** orbital, operations, environment.
- **Primary downstream:** space-network, access-network, ground-segment, network-control.
- **Boundary:** this subsystem owns only its domain state and behavior; external orchestration, shared event timing, visualization and experiment storage belong to platform services. Avoid implementing neighboring domains inside this module.
- **Control plane:** receives versioned commands and configuration; emits state transition events.
- **Data plane:** if relevant, operates on typed link/packet/bearer state without cross-process RPC per packet.

## 5. Interfaces and contracts

**Initial API surfaces:** 卫星能力快照;载荷启停命令;健康事件订阅.

**Domain events:** `SatelliteCommissioned`, `PayloadModeChanged`, `SatelliteDegraded`, `SatelliteUnavailable`.

Define each message's producer, consumer, schema, timestamps, idempotency and failure semantics before implementation. Consumers must tolerate delayed, duplicated and stale events where execution mode permits.

## 6. Lifecycle and failure modes

**Expected failure/edge cases:** 载荷失效; 姿态不可达; 功率不足; 热约束; 状态过期.

State transitions must be observable. For each fault, specify detection, propagation to dependent systems, impact on traffic, recovery and user-visible outcome. Fault injection is an explicit test input.

## 7. Technology and open-source integration

**Candidates:** 通用航天器仿真模型;NASA cFS仅作为可选航天软件实验.

Use Rust for performance-sensitive state/event/packet logic, Python for scientific/orbital/experiment workflows and TypeScript for UI when applicable. Existing C/C++ stacks remain independent adapters. These are candidates, not approved or verified dependencies.

## 8. Verification and acceptance

**Priority acceptance cases:** 载荷关闭后相关链路不可用; 功率限制导致容量变化; 状态事件有序.

Each case needs reproducible input, fixed seed where stochastic, expected invariants, per-hop/per-entity trace, and explicit fidelity label. Cross-system acceptance is indexed in [system scenarios](../system-scenarios.md).

## Architectural contract and implementation requirements

### Domain model and ownership
- Own the entities above as authoritative state; external systems consume snapshots or events, not direct mutation.
- Explicitly document each state machine (initial, active, degraded, failed, recovering) and legal transitions. Avoid global singleton mutable state.
- All measurements include units; geometry includes reference frame and epoch; time-bearing events distinguish simulated time, orbital UTC and wall clock.

### Interfaces and consistency
- Version messages with `schema_version`, `run_id`, `scenario_id`, `sim_time_ns`, `sequence`, `source`, `trace_id`.
- Separate queries, commands and domain events. Define idempotency keys and error codes for mutating commands; allow batched snapshots for large constellations.
- In deterministic runs, process events in stable timestamp/priority/sequence order. Hot-path packet handling must not depend on synchronous remote RPC.

### Fidelity and performance
- **L0 analytical:** geometry/aggregate capacity without packets; **L1 discrete event:** packets, queues, modeled links; **L2 protocol:** external validated PHY/MAC stacks; **L3 emulation:** real Linux/IP packets; **L4 HIL:** optional SDR/hardware under legal constraints.
- Every model records assumptions, source, validation reference, version, seed and expected scalability. Report measured performance, not hypothetical throughput.

### Test and operational requirements
- Unit tests cover model invariants and invalid inputs; contract tests cover versioning; integration tests cover upstream/downstream events; E2E tests cover failure and recovery.
- Emit domain events, per-entity metrics, trace correlation and structured error reasons; capture artifacts for reproducibility.
- Never claim proprietary Starlink compatibility; third-party integration requires license, maintenance and model-fidelity review.

## 9. Delivery milestones

- **M0 Contract:** entities, states, interfaces, units, scenario fixtures and failure semantics reviewed.
- **M1 Analytical:** deterministic simplified model with unit and contract tests.
- **M2 Integrated:** participates in a whole-system E2E scenario with trace and fault injection.
- **M3 Fidelity:** reference-calibrated physical/protocol model or reviewed upstream adapter.
- **M4 Scale/Operations:** benchmarks, observability, resource limits and recovery validated.

M0 documentation does **not** mean M1–M4 is implemented.
